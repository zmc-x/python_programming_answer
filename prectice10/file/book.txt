I would have, then, our ordinary dwelling-houses built to last and built
to be lovely; as rich and full of pleasantness as may be within and
without: ✠✠✠✠ with such differences as might suit and express each man’s
character and occupation, and partly his history.

 “The crowded line of masons with trowels in their right hands, rapidly
    laying the long side-wall
 The flexible, rise and fall of backs, the continual click of the trowels
    striking the bricks,
 The bricks, one after another, each laid so workmanlike in its place,
    and set with a knock of the trowel handle”

[Illustration: A FOREWORD]

It is the purpose in issuing this brochure to give simply a few
suggestions of what may be accomplished by the use of plain and moulded
brick. Here and there some of the parts such as consoles, pier caps, and
carved portions, are of a necessity made either of terra-cotta or stone;
but as this is a perfectly legitimate combination they are here used.

The brick forms shown in Part Two are only suggestive of the various
shapes in use, as the requirements of architectural design develop an
unlimited number of forms. The facilities are such that any desired
shape or size may be made.

             O fortunate, O happy day,
             When a new household finds its place
             Among the myriad homes of earth,
             Like a new star just sprung to birth,
             And rolled on its harmonious way
             Into the boundless realms of space.

                                 “The Hanging of the Crane”
                                               Longfellow.

               Met, where the guardian wall is wound,
               So subtly are our eyes beguiled
               We see not nor suspect a bound.
               No more than in some forest wild;
               The sight is free as air—or crost
               Only by art in nature lost.

                                       “A Flower Garden”
                                             Wordsworth.

                If travellers beneath thee stay
                Till storms have worn themselves away,
                That time in praising thee they spend,
                And thy protecting power commend.”

                  In baffled rage at pane and door,
                While the red logs before us beat
                  The frost-line back with tropic heat;
                And ever when a louder blast
                  Shook beam and rafter as it passed,
                The merrier up its roaring draught
                The great throat of the chimney laughed,

                 A couchant tiger’s seemed to fall;

While these suggestions are mainly to illustrate the use of moulded
brick, they but partially represent the line carried, as all clay
products known to the trade are handled, such as:—

                     Ornamental Terra-Cotta,
                     Hollow Tile Fire-Proofing,
                     Terra-Cotta Roof Tile,
                     Fancy and Moulded Front Brick,
                     Enameled Brick,
                     Paving Brick,
                     Fire Brick, &c.

If you do not find what you desire among these sketches possibly it may
be found among the moulds at the factory, or if not, such will be made
if ordered in sufficient quantity. All known colors and effects,
including the ordinary red pressed shapes, can be obtained.

  “Houses are built to live in, not to look on, therefore, let use be
    preferred before uniformity, except where both may be had.”

[Illustration: FIRE-PROOFING]

It is no longer a question of experiment:—that of thoroughly protecting
iron and steel structural work. Terra-cotta has proved itself superior
to all other materials in use, in maintaining its original position
during fire, thereby thoroughly protecting the structural work, as has
been demonstrated at recent conflagrations. The forms in general use are
floor arches, partition blocks, column and girder coverings, furring
tile, ceiling and roofing blocks; while special forms can be made when
required. Estimates for the furnishing of material, either delivered or
erected, will be given; also full information in regard to plans or
specifications if desired.

[Illustration: FLOOR ARCHES:—“A” segmental arch; “B” & “C” flat
arches—“C” regular side construction; “B” end construction, lighter in
weight than other forms and carries a heavier floor load.]

size or thickness, either hard or porous, and scored for plaster unless
otherwise ordered.]

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
